## Project 4 - Operationalize a Machine Learning Microservice API

This Microservice is part of the Operationalize Machine Learning project prepared from Scikit-Learn . It includes a model that forecasts Boston home values based on a number of characteristics, including the typical number of rooms in a home and information on highway accessibility, teacher-to-student ratios, and other factors. You may read more about the data on [the data source site] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing), which was where the original Kaggle data came from.

You are given a pre-trained, sklearn model that has been trained to predict housing prices in Boston according to several features, such as average rooms in a home and data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratios, and so on.
